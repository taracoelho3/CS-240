CS 240 Fall 2021 Coding Project 1

This repository is intentionally empty. You should create and add a makefile and all 
source code files that you need for this assignment. Feel free to copy the makefile
from CP0 and edit it to make appropriate targets, dependencies, etc. for your code.

You should structure your code as we did for CP0, with separate class definition (.h), 
class implementation (.cpp) and other files, and separate compilation and linking 
performed via make.  Building this up from scratch for this assignment should help
reinforce those concepts.
